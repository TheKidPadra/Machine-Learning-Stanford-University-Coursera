Presented herein are my solutions to the programming assignments and quizzes for the [Machine Learning (ML)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course offered by [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), instructed by the esteemed [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). Upon successful completion of this course, a comprehensive understanding of various ML algorithms can be acquired. The projects were implemented using both Matlab and Python programming languages, with both implementations available in this repository, accompanied by the corresponding source codes in their respective formats. I encourage attempting to solve the assignments independently at first, but should any challenges arise, you are welcome to refer to the provided code.

## About this Course



-------------
## Applied Learning Project

Upon completion of this Specialization, you will possess the skills to:
- Construct machine learning models in Python utilizing well-known libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Develop and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.
- Design and train a neural network using TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
- Implement best practices in machine learning development to ensure that your models are capable of generalizing to real-world data and tasks.
- Construct and utilize decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
- Employ unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering and anomaly detection, for unsupervised learning scenarios.
- Create recommender systems using collaborative filtering approaches and content-based deep learning methods.
- Construct a deep reinforcement learning model."
